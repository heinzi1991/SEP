# Software Entwicklung und Praktikum 2016

## Short Declaration about the Project:
The game to be implemented is a modified version of the maze of Pokemon.
The goal of the game is to reach the goal from the starting field. To achieve the goal,
the player has a limited number of steps available. 
In the maze, there are special fields, that make it easier for the player to reach the goal,
but there are also fields, that make it harder. 
There may also be several ways to get to the goal.

## Field types
* '#'          => Wall
* ' '          => Path
* 'o'          => Start Field
* 'x'          => Goal Field
* '+'          => Ice Field
* 'A-Z'        => Teleport Field
* '>, <, ^, v' => One Way FieldÂ 
* 'a-e'        => Bonus Field
* 'f-j'        => Quicksand Field
